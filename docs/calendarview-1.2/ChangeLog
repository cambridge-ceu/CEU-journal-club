Version 1.2 - May 13th, 2009

 - Fixed some CSS rules in the packaged stylesheet so that days from other
   months and the current date are styled the way they were intended.

 - Reorganized the repository a bit and added an example to the downloadable
   package.

 - Added some release packaging scripts to ease distribution of new releases.

 - Fixed the display of days from other months in the default CSS. Thanks to
   Corie Slate for reporting this issue.

 - Fixed a compatibility issue with Internet Explorer 8. Thanks to Gabriel
   Engel for this fix.

Version 1.1 - October 19th, 2008

 - Upgraded to Prototype 1.6 and cleaned up code to take full advantage of its
   new API features.

 - Removed our dependency on Builder from script.aculo.us, as Prototype 1.6
   has its own DOM Builder now.

 - Fixed a bug where navigating through months of the calendar would display
   the wrong year when you reached December. Thanks to Dirk Koritnik for the
   fix and for everyone who reported the issue.

Version 1.0 - March 12th, 2007
